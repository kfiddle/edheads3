        <h2 class="accordion">What can I do at Edheads?</h2>

        <div class="accordion">Why do some activities take a long time to download?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
           <p>Our activities have cool graphics, great sound, and a ton of animations,
               so the size of some activities can be pretty big. This means activities
               will take longer to download if you have a slower connection.
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">What if I see an objectionable advertisement?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>Please copy the web address on the ad and send it to us at
                <a href = "mailto: info@edheads.org">info@edheads.org</a>.
                We make every effort to keep objectionable material
                off the Edheads website and appreciate reports that help us keep the
                site appropriate for all ages.
            </p>

        <div class="accordion">What if I have an idea for a new activity?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>Please e-mail us with your ideas!  We can be reached at
                <a href = "mailto: info@edheads.org">info@edheads.org</a>.
                We can't guarantee we'll turn your idea into reality,
                but we do listen and we do make every attempt to accommodate our users.
                All ideas must be funded, though, and we cannot promise that every idea
                will become a successful fundraising proposal.

        <div class="accordion">How did Edheads get started?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>
                Eric Bort and Gail Wheatley started Edheads.
                They met in early 2000 through a mutual friend,
                Eric and Gail had a long brainstorming session
                about how the Internet should really be used to educate.
                But it would take some time before the first grant came in
                and the first activity,Simple Machines, would launch.
                Today, Eric runs his own company and Gail oversees the
                Edheads operation, along with a  fabulous Board of Directors
                and a bunch of super cool volunteers.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="accordion">Where do you get  your ideas?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>Our ideas come from a lot of places. Sometimes our users write in with
            ideas of activities they'd like to see
            (and no, sorry, we won't be producing things where
            hundreds of knee patients die violent deaths or you
            win by just having better eye-hand coordination than someone else)
            or scientists, corporations, and teachers give us ideas. </p>
            <p>We also have a LOT of ideas of our own! We get ideas from the
                news of the day and the exciting areas of research that are making headlines.
                So, we are pretty open to ideas and there is no shortage of them.
                The challenge is to come up with ideas and get those  ideas funded.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">Who can I write to if I have specific questions or concerns?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>E-mail <a href = "mailto: info@edheads.org">info@edheads.org</a> for graphic, technical,
                sponsorship, educational, business, fundraising practices,
                and partnerships concerns, comments, or questions.
                Or, well, really anything else you can think of, too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">Who builds this stuff?
        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>Lots of different people! We work with teachers, kids,
                designers, writers and many others to create the full
                Edheads experience! If you would like to partner with us to
                develop new projects, please contact
