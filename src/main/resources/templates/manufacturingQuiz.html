      <p>Play Edheads’Manufacturing Technician Game</p>
      <p>Do an internet search for ‘tech camps,’ ‘manufacturing camps,’ or computer or robotics camps.
        All of these provide skills used in manufacturing. In Columbus, Ohio,
        check out TechCorps, which holds full-day, weeklong summer
        “Techie Camps” where middle-school students are able to immerse
        themselves in activities such as computer programming, and web and app
        development. <a href="https:www.twenty.techcorps.org">twenty.techcorps.org</a>
      </p>

      <p>Talk to your teachers or guidance counselors about entering a technical
        training course aimed at a manufacturing career, such as a Fab Lab course or Manufacturing Pathway.</p>

      <p>After high school, pursue an associate degree in Manufacturing or Mechanical
        Engineering Technology from local college institutions (In Ohio: Rhodes State,
        Columbus State, Marion Technical, Edison Community, Sinclair Community and Clark State).</p>

      <p>Ask about a work-study pilot program allows students the opportunity to work at
        Honda or some other manufacturing plant three days a week, while taking classes
        two days. You can build technical skills while earning your degree.
        Honda is expanding their program in the future, and many other manufacturers have similar programs.</p>

      <p>Ask about certification programs at local career skills centers.
        Many of these centers now provide classes and certifications that allow you to
        leave high school already employed.
